This project is focused on utilizing JavaScript ES6 classes and advanced features like static methods, inheritance, and metaprogramming with symbols. It begins by explaining how to define classes in ES6, emphasizing the use of the `class` keyword to encapsulate object properties and methods. The project demonstrates how instance methods are shared among all objects of a class, along with getters and setters to control property access.

It further delves into static methods, which are not tied to any particular instance of a class but rather the class itself. These methods are particularly useful for utility functions or operations that do not depend on object state. The project also explores inheritance using the `extends` keyword, allowing classes to build upon others, while the `super` keyword is used to invoke parent class methods and constructors.

Finally, the project introduces metaprogramming concepts like using symbols to create private properties, preventing property collisions, and employing proxies for custom behavior on object property access. This advanced technique enables more secure and flexible object handling. The examples provided showcase each of these concepts, helping developers understand and implement them in real-world applications.
